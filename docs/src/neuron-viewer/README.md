# Neuron viewer

The easiest way to view neurons and explanations is using the
[public website](https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/neuron-explainer/neuron-viewer/index.html).
This directory contains the implementation of that website as well as lightweight servers that make
it possible to run an alternative version of the website locally.

## Local development

Install:

```npm install```

Run the backend:

```npm run startpy```

Run the frontend:

```npm start```
